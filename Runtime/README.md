# Runtime dependencies

The Swift source files in this directory contain code on which compiled Swiftemplate templates may depend. Include these files in your projects to allow the templates to work. 

Note that if you are using the templates with the [Malimbe](https://github.com/andrewcb/malimbe/) framework, you can skip this step, as Malimbe includes these extensions.
